              <p><h1>2)Blockchain</h1><br>
                
                  Blockchain, sometimes referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), makes the history of any digital asset unalterable and transparent through the use of decentralization and cryptographic hashing.  <br><br>
                  <iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lD9KAnkZUjU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>

                  A simple analogy for understanding blockchain technology is a Google Doc. When we create a document and share it with a group of people, the document is distributed instead of copied or transferred. This creates a decentralized distribution chain that gives everyone access to the document at the same time. No one is locked out awaiting changes from another party, while all modifications to the doc are being recorded in real-time, making changes completely transparent.<br>

            <h1>3)Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality</h1><br>

                <h3>Virtual Reality</h3>

                  <p>This technology immerses users in a completely virtual environment that is generated by a computer. The most advanced VR experiences even provide freedom of movement – users can move in a digital environment and hear sounds. Moreover, special hand controllers can be used to enhance VR experiences.</p>

                  <p>You need to wear a special VR headset to experience virtual reality. Most VR headsets are connected to a computer (Oculus Rift) or a gaming console (PlayStation VR) but there are standalone devices (Google Cardboard is among the most popular) as well. Most standalone VR headsets work in combination with smartphones – you insert a smartphone, wear a headset, and immerse in the virtual reality.<br><br><iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3mr_S5mOtsw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </p>

                  <b>Immersive videos</b><br>

                  <p>Have you ever noticed a small cardboard icon when watching videos on YouTube? It enables the 360-degree mode that means you can wear a VR headset and experiences fully immersive videos. 360-degree videos are considered a form of VR.</p>


                  <h3>Augmented Reality</h3>

                  <p>In augmented reality, users see and interact with the real world while digital content is added to it. If this sounds unclear think of Pokemon Go – millions of people all over the world have been rushing with their smartphones in search for small virtual creatures. That’s the most vivid example of augmented reality.<br><br>

                  If you own a modern smartphone, you can easily download an AR app and try this technology. There’s a different way to experience augmented reality, though – with special AR headsets, such as Google Glass, where digital content is displayed on a tiny screen in front of a user’s eye.</p>

                  <h3>Mixed Reality</h3>

                  <p>This is the most recent development in reality technologies that sometimes causes confusion, primarily because different experiences are called so. Without going too deep into science, let’s look at two forms of reality technologies that are referred to as mixed reality (we’ve mentioned just one of them at the very beginning):</p><br><br>

                  <ul><li>Mixed reality that starts with the real world – virtual objects are not just overlaid on the real world but can interact with it. In this case, a user remains in the real-world environment while digital content is added to it; moreover, a user can interact with virtual objects. This form of mixed reality can be considered an advanced form of AR. If you can’t figure out how this works, take a look at how Skype is used on Microsoft HoloLens.</li>
                 <li> Mixed reality that starts with the virtual world – the digital environment is anchored to and replaces the real world. In this case, a user is fully immersed in the virtual environment while the real world is blocked out. Sounds like virtual reality, right? In fact it does, but the digital objects overlap the real ones whereas in conventional VR the virtual environment isn’t connected to the real world around a user. To experience this form of mixed reality, you can wear Windows mixed reality headsets. Here’s an example of how it all works.</li>

              <h1>4)Cloud Computing</h1>

                <P> <b style="font-size: 27px">What is cloud computing, in simple terms?</b><br>

                Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services -- from applications to storage and processing power -- typically over the internet and on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>

                <b style="font-size: 27px">How does cloud computing work?</b>

                <p>Rather than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.<br>

                One benefit of using cloud computing services is that firms can avoid the upfront cost and complexity of owning and maintaining their own IT infrastructure, and instead simply pay for what they use, when they use it.<br>

                In turn, providers of cloud computing services can benefit from significant economies of scale by delivering the same services to a wide range of customers.<b><br>
                <iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dH0yz-Osy54" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
              </p>

              <b style="font-size: 27px">What are examples of cloud computing?</b>

              <p>Cloud computing underpins a vast number of services. That includes consumer services like Gmail or the cloud back-up of the photos on your smartphone, though to the services which allow large enterprises to host all their data and run all of their applications in the cloud. Netflix relies on cloud computing services to run its its video streaming service and its other business systems too, and have a number of other organisations.<br>

              Cloud computing is becoming the default option for many apps: software vendors are increasingly offering their applications as services over the internet rather than standalone products as they try to switch to a subscription model. However, there is a potential downside to cloud computing, in that it can also introduce new costs and new risks for companies using it.</p>

              <p><h1>5)Angular and React</h1><br><br\>
              <p>When students ask which JavaScript framework to use for frontend website development projects—Angular vs React.js vs Vue.js, I have to admit there’s no perfect answer. Instead, I guide them through the pros and cons of each option. I frame the comparison through each framework’s key features, its industry popularity, and overall performance and developer-side user experience. <br><br>

              Before diving into the comparison of each web development framework, here’s a quick overview of each option:</p>

             <h2> Angular</h2>

              <p>Angular 8 is the latest version of Angular, a JavaScript framework maintained by Google, which is client-side and browser-based. Rather than speaking to a server to reload HTML pages, Angular allows websites to render quickly and efficiently. It’s an all-in-one framework, with built-in tools for routing, state-management solutions, and form validation. Angular is built on TypeScript a superset of JavaScript. </p>

              <h2>React.js</h2>

              <p>Developed and maintained by Facebook, React.js is a popular JavaScript library that focuses on building and rendering components for a web page. With React.js, everything is built in JavaScript and I recommend using it with JSX, a JavaScript syntax extension, that “describes what the UI should look like” in your JavaScript code. <br><br>
                <iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xDhzYQ4VyCw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>

              Unlike Angular, it’s not a complete suite of tools, React.js is comprised of tools that help you build components to be dropped into a page. This allows React.js to be lean, but it does require developers to use additional libraries to include functionalities that React.js lacks. For example, routing is not included in React.js, so that would have to be added manually through third-party tools. </p>

              <h2>Vue.js</h2>

              <p>Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework combining features from both React.js and Angular. Unlike React.js and Facebook, Vue.js doesn’t have a large tech company behind its development. It was created by former Google employee, Evan You, who has since amassed a core team that maintains the routing and state management of Vue.js.<br><br>

              Like Angular, Vue.js is a complete framework, albeit with fewer features and packages. Thanks to extensive documentation on Vue.js and the simplicity of its syntax, programmers of all experience levels, even those with a beginner-level of JavaScript and HTML knowledge, should find this framework a straightforward option.</p>
